### Details

*Notes Length: Standard*

* **Score of the BTA Game** Shawn Jones asked Derek Hawkins about the BTA game, which Hawkins had missed. Jones informed Hawkins that the score was 3 to 31, and they discussed the status of the team, noting that Miles Garrett broke the sack record. Jones and Hawkins speculated about the team's playoff chances, with Jones predicting an exit in the first round due to the fluidity of the standings, which makes it hard to predict who they would face ([00:00:00](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.leablf1s0zhq)).

* **Discussion on Quarterbacks and Team Performance** Shawn Jones and Derek Hawkins discussed the team's performance, noting that Shadur Sanders was brought back, and Jones commented that Sanders, being a rookie, takes more chances than Dylan Gabriel ([00:02:31](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.j0bxa14lv6ke)). They also talked about Philip Rivers possibly returning to the league, with Hawkins expressing surprise that Rivers, at 44, would attempt to play after five years of retirement, particularly when other players like Colin Kaepernick are unable to get a gig ([00:03:34](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.5nttdnzh0l0y)). Jones observed that Rivers looked like they came "off the couch," questioning the physical and conditioning tests, which highlighted their concern about the state of quarterbacking in the NFL ([00:04:31](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.tmvq72t2gipd)).

* **Cleveland Browns Quarterback History** Jeremiah Tillman joined the call, and the speakers discussed the recent game, with Tillman noting that either the Bears were good or the Browns were bad ([00:05:39](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.piwr11uyie49)). Shawn Jones shared a statistic that the Browns have had 42 starting quarterbacks since 1999, compared to the Bears' 30, and pointed out the shared quarterback instability among Great Lakes teams, excluding the Packers ([00:07:30](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.48cbr6dk9777)).

* **Updates and Meeting with Legal Advisor** Shawn Jones provided a brief agenda for the meeting, which included focusing on priority alignment, reviewing mockups, and discussing next steps. Jones announced a meeting with their legal advisor, their younger sister who is an active attorney with the Charlotte Hornets/NBA, to take place the following week ([00:09:22](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.erd2bf4y3bjm)) ([00:15:18](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.huox8t5rmoai)). The purpose of this meeting is to align on the business needs and specifically to flush out the privacy policy regarding data capture and usage ([00:16:26](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.8cmdti63tkv6)).

* **Importance of Prioritization and Core Business Focus** Shawn Jones emphasized the need for the team to prioritize and focus on the main business objectives, especially since they are currently behind ([00:10:18](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.mttx40wlan1x)). Jones shared a framework for execution, including steps like footsteps, prioritize, plan, design, build, launch, optimize, and scale, stressing that proper prioritization is critical to avoiding wasted effort ([00:11:20](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.cgana6yhftxv)). Jones outlined a process for prioritization by asking what problem is being solved, how it impacts business goals, what variables exist, and if necessary components for a solution are currently available ([00:12:14](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.u8ya1eyrstgi)).

* **Legal Focus on Privacy Policy and Data Usage** Shawn Jones explained that the upcoming meeting with the legal advisor will focus on three key areas: terms and conditions, privacy policy, and refunds/returns. The legal advisor specifically wants to understand the data the company is capturing, such as customer information for drop shipping and data for marketing and analytics, to accurately draft the privacy policy language ([00:16:26](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.8cmdti63tkv6)). Jones asked Jeremiah Tillman and Derek Hawkins to prepare some high-level thoughts on their analytical focus and how they plan to leverage data to help the legal advisor ([00:18:37](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.qbutp0cucdcu)).

* **Chief Legal Officer Role** Shawn Jones informed the team that their legal advisor will become the Chief Legal Officer once they reach their marker, emphasizing the benefit of having them involved from the groundwork phase. Jones then handed the discussion over to Derek Hawkins to review the mockups ([00:19:41](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.o84q0yj27rqe)).

* **Review of Website Mockups and Search Functionality** Derek Hawkins presented a mockup, which was a reverse-engineered component library based on Shopify's foundation ([00:22:00](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.wzr6ic5t3uxt)). Jones and Hawkins compared the original website version to the new developer mode version ([00:24:06](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.jrxzh2mlor2v)). Jones expressed a preference for the original design's search functionality, arguing that the "Shop Now" or "Explore Collection" in the new mockup adds an unnecessary step and hinders the ability to capture search habits for optimization ([00:26:02](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.f1cuzlniq4ql)). They agreed to make the search bar prominent in the hero section, similar to the original design ([00:27:58](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.y7pat52ns5mn)).

* **Feedback on Homepage Components** Shawn Jones reviewed the proposed components for the homepage, approving the "Featured Categories" section and suggesting the inclusion of seasonal categories ([00:27:58](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.y7pat52ns5mn)). Jones recommended replacing "Best Sellers" with "New Arrivals," noting that "Best Sellers" requires sales data which they currently lack ([00:28:58](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.lerxis4pj4j0)). Hawkins also questioned the necessity of a "Why Choose Highly?" section, and Jones suggested integrating that information into an "About Us" section instead ([00:29:56](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.4w6rgg49ph8f)).

* **Newsletter and Promotion Slideshow** Shawn Jones liked the newsletter sign-up section and proposed enhancing it by adding a promotion, such as "Get 10% off your first order," and incorporating a slideshow showcasing various discounts ([00:30:55](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.lilxevu273dw)). Derek Hawkins agreed to implement a slideshow or slider based on the newsletter data inputs in the Shopify dashboard ([00:32:15](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.r5266dt44wwm)). Jones specified that if the promotion is claimable, the slider should allow the user to go back to claim it, drawing inspiration from websites like Walmart and Target ([00:33:22](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.e1mutin9woi5)) ([00:35:37](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.wkls1lrpanux)).

* **Product Listing and Categories** Derek Hawkins clarified the difference between the "Products" tab, which leads to product listings, and "Categories," which organizes products ([00:39:07](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.5id0ula4iu0s)). Hawkins showed the product listing page with a three-column layout, including a hide/show filter feature, and a quick view option on hover ([00:40:09](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.6hb0sehhueo0)). Shawn Jones emphasized that for "Similar Items," they need to identify key product attributes to generate the list effectively, suggesting it should be postponed since it is a higher-level e-commerce function requiring data ([00:42:18](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.fw8dqyewwj08)).

* **Category Pages and Taxonomy** Shawn Jones praised the "Shop by Category" layout in the mockup but emphasized the need to show the breadcrumb structure and visual aids for drill-down categories, referencing the L1, L2, L3 levels of the product taxonomy ([00:43:22](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.b4gmf0ejeckf)) ([00:46:58](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.hvw2hlktfqq4)). Jones used Amazon and Target's taxonomy models as examples of how categories branch down to the product level ([00:45:49](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.xmwwherkxukg)) ([00:48:20](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.ppgz5898px2l)). Jones advised Hawkins to look at how larger e-commerce sites, like Walmart and Target, structure their category pages and utilize images for L2 and subsequent levels ([00:49:26](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.l8b407mcq4xn)) ([00:52:25](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.t1zeluxa0nmx)).

* **Product Detail Page Design** Shawn Jones expressed a strong preference for the three-column layout of the product detail page, similar to Walmart, due to its organization and ability to keep key information visible during scrolling. Jones suggested removing the specs from the main view and placing them in the long description, warranty, and warnings sections ([00:53:20](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.vn1som2e4c7q)) ([00:55:22](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.1p9grd5q72sv)). Jones concluded that the product detail page should look like Walmart's, but the category pages should use a simpler, more visually driven layout for L2 and L3 categories, with facets appearing only at the product end node ([00:56:49](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.clwvyfyzg9y3)).

* **Product Display and Faceted Search** Shawn Jones discussed how products are displayed and filtered, noting that the faceted search is showing up on the page but that the number of results, such as 915 results for headphones, suggests a large volume of products. They suggested that product views should initially be shown based on most views or sales once data is available, but currently they would show all available products, letting data eventually dictate the presentation ([00:58:21](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.9qou89myieci)).

* **Product Listing and Subcategory Views** Derek Hawkins distinguished between the product listing and product subcategory pages, noting that the subcategory page is reached by clicking a category, which then highlights the subcategory and displays all relevant products ([00:59:56](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.gm9dyfa3sk5o)). They also acknowledged the need to streamline subcategories, specifically the L2s and deeper levels, and mentioned a separate development version of the site being worked on. Derek Hawkins demonstrated a quick view functionality that shows product details and options to add to cart or navigate to the full product detail page ([01:01:04](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.4u4ytlkw88y7)).

* **Product Data and Breadcrumbs** Shawn Jones confirmed that products are loaded, directing Derek Hawkins to the Shopify product section to view the available items ([01:02:12](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.g4rnkenvqd41)). They discussed the importance of product breadcrumbs, with Shawn Jones demonstrating where to find the detailed breadcrumb tree within the Shopify meta fields and meta objects, noting that this structure needs to be visualized on the site ([01:05:21](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.byfccn3e93yd)). Shawn Jones advised Derek Hawkins to prioritize building out breadcrumb visualization only for categories where products currently exist to shortcut development work ([01:08:20](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.bx0vcrjiawpj)).

* **Checkout Process and Shipping** Derek Hawkins walked through the checkout process, explaining that the "Add to Cart" button functions locally, while the "Buy Now" button initiates the checkout flow, including the cart overview ([01:11:26](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.mx51p7usi1ys)). Shawn Jones confirmed that the promo code field is for discounts like 10% or 20% off. Regarding shipping, Shawn Jones suggested changing the address type options to "Home, Family, Friend, Office, Other" and emphasized that shipping method details should not be shown upfront due to the drop-shipping model, but rather an estimated time of delivery should be provided at the final review stage ([01:12:36](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.49vlhgbch7jz)).

* **Payment and Order Confirmation** The discussion covered payment processing, with Derek Hawkins confirming the need to use a third-party payment processor for security and cost efficiency ([01:14:44](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.hl6xupphirhj)). They then discussed the necessity for an order confirmation process, which involves sending out emails for events such as order confirmation and password resets. Shawn Jones suggested changing the estimated time of delivery text to state that delivery time will be emailed to the customer, based on information received from the wholesaler, which should also include tracking and estimated time details ([01:15:41](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.orkb863j1ops)).

* **Order Tracking and Guest Checkout** Derek Hawkins presented the order tracking functionality, offering two paths: logged-in customers can view their orders in a table and click to track, or customers can input their order number and email address ([01:17:45](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.k28atube5wxf)). Shawn Jones suggested that to maintain a consistent tracking experience for both account holders and guests, they should ensure guests are required to provide an email during checkout ([01:18:56](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.77oyb78s00st)). They also recommended adding an "Orders and Returns" button on the homepage's top right, which would direct users to the tracking functionality ([01:20:13](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.8d3nyjjtclvb)).

* **Homepage and UI/UX Updates** Shawn Jones requested changes to the homepage category display, preferring a secondary bar, or mega menu, that drops down to show L1 categories like Electronics and Home and Garden when clicking on "categories" ([01:23:39](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.ylms1rhjdv26)). Shawn Jones also shared that they have provided access to data models that detail the L1 groupings and facets to help Derek Hawkins with the development work ([01:26:08](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.492yw7200aee)). They also suggested changing the layout of the product category pages to a three-column approach, similar to what Walmart uses, and noted a need to refine the text above the search bar ([01:29:25](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.pu2bnps8is54)).

* **Footer Content and Future Development** Shawn Jones and Derek Hawkins discussed the content for the footer banner, agreeing to include elements like privacy policies and terms of use, but opting against displaying a sitemap ([01:30:27](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.9nn68hqy3468)). Shawn Jones mentioned that accessibility features are a future concern as the company scales ([01:31:30](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.cdcw5w7z8hgk)). In terms of immediate next steps, Derek Hawkins confirmed they have a design for the sign-up and sign-in pages and will work on the account management pages next, which will include visibility of customer orders ([01:32:21](?tab=t.6w1epb3l1rss#heading=h.qi8djz5udghj)).
